Francis Bach is a researcher at Inria, leading since 2011 the machine learning project-team, which is part of the Computer Science Department at Ecole Normale Sup\'erieure. He graduated from Ecole Polytechnique in 1997 and completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley in 2005, working with Professor Michael Jordan. He spent two years in the Mathematical Morphology group at Ecole des Mines de Paris, then he joined the computer vision project-team at Inria/Ecole Normale Sup\'erieure from 2007 to 2010. Francis Bach is primarily interested in machine learning, and especially in graphical models, sparse methods, kernel-based learning, large-scale convex optimization, computer vision and signal processing. He obtained in 2009 a Starting Grant and in 2016 a Consolidator Grant from the European Research Council, and received in 2012 the Inria young researcher prize. In 2015, he was program co-chair of the International Conference in Machine learning (ICML).\\\\

\textbf{Abstract:}\\

Many machine learning and signal processing problems are traditionally cast as convex optimization problems where the objective function is a sum of many simple terms. In this situation, batch algorithms compute gradients of the objective function by summing all individual gradients at every iteration and exhibit a linear convergence rate for strongly-convex problems. Stochastic methods rather select a single function at random at every iteration, classically leading to cheaper iterations but with a convergence rate which decays only as the inverse of the number of iterations. In this talk, I will present the stochastic averaged gradient (SAG) algorithm which is dedicated to minimizing finite sums of smooth functions; it has a linear convergence rate for strongly-convex problems, but with an iteration cost similar to stochastic gradient descent, thus leading to faster convergence for machine learning and signal processing problems. I will also mention several extensions, in particular to saddle-point problems, showing that this new class of incremental algorithms applies more generally.

\textbf{Abstract:}\\
The famous Shannon-Nyquist theorem has become a landmark in the development of digital signal processing. However, in many modern applications, the signal bandwidths have increased tremendously, while the acquisition capabilities have not scaled sufficiently fast. Consequently, conversion to digital has become a serious bottleneck. Furthermore, the resulting high rate digital data requires storage, communication and processing at very high rates which is computationally expensive and requires large amounts of power. In the context of medical imaging sampling at high rates often translates to high radiation dosages, increased scanning times, bulky medical devices, and limited resolution. In this talk, we present a framework for sampling and processing a wide class of wideband analog signals at rates far below Nyquist by exploiting signal structure and the processing task and show several demos of real-time sub-Nyquist prototypes. We then consider applications of these ideas to a variety of problems in medical and optical imaging including fast and quantitative MRI, wireless ultrasound, fast Doppler imaging, and correlation based super-resolution in microscopy and ultrasound which combines high spatial resolution with short integration time. We end by discussing several modern methods for structure-based phase retrieval which has applications in several areas of optical imaging.

Mrs Clarisse Manjary Mandridake received his PhD in Image and Signal Processing from the University of Bordeaux I, France, for her works on bi-dimensional signal decomposition applied to classification of textured images, done in Laboratoire Automatique Productique et Traitement du Signal, and in closed connection with ARIANA Project in INRIA Sophia-Antipolis. She joined the research team of Advestigo for her postdoc year in 2002. As a researcher at Advestigo and later at Hologram Industries (now renamed SURYS), she developed technologies for the representation, indexation and search of images and videos in large scale databases. She is now in charge of the coordination of the research project for the SURYS digital labs and animates the scientist partnerships with University labs. Her expertise covers Applied Mathematics, image characterization, fingerprinting and authentication on various physical supports, from ID documents to smartlabels. More recently, his area of interest is to contribute to technological innovation for use by poor countries or developing countries in order to help them put in place what is called "good governance". It is a sine qua non Condition for any future economic development.

Dr. Anna M. Michalak is a faculty member in the Department of Global Ecology of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California, and an Associate Professor in the Department of Earth System Science at Stanford University. Prior to joining Carnegie, she was the Frank and Brooke Transue Faculty Scholar and Associate Professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Her research interests primarily lie in two areas. She explores the impacts of climate change and extreme events on freshwater and coastal water quality via influences on nutrient delivery to, and on conditions within, water bodies. She also studies the cycling and emissions of greenhouse gases at the Earth surface at regional to global scales ? scales directly relevant to informing climate science and policy ? primarily through the use of atmospheric observations that provide the clearest constraints at these critical scales. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (nominated by NASA), the NSF CAREER award, the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors Outstanding Educator Award, and the Leopold Fellowship in environmental leadership. Dr. Michalak holds a B.Sc. from the University of Guelph, Canada, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford.
