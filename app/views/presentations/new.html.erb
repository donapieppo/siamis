<div class="alert alert-notice">
  Contributed presentations in lecture or poster format are invited in all areas consistent with the conference themes. A <strong>lecture</strong> format is generally a 15-minute oral presentation with an additional 5 minutes for discussion. Talk lengths will be determined by the co-chairs at the close of submissions. A <strong>poster</strong> format involves the use of non-electronic visual aids for mounting on a 4’ x 8’ poster board. A poster session is two hours long. Each contributor, either for a lecture or a poster, must submit a title and a brief abstract not to exceed 75 words.
