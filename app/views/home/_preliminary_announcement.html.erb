<p> The SIAM Activity Group on Imaging Science (SIAG/IS) and the Bologna Committee for IS Conference 2018 (BCIS18) organize the biennial SIAM Conference on Imaging Science, one of the world’s largest, most influential biennial event in imaging science and mathematical aspects in imaging. Four days of research results, educational sessions, highligthing the community’s latest research achievements, and commercial exhibits displaying the industry's current software and services.

<p> The SIAM Conference on Imaging Science, for the first time in Europe, brings together scientists and engineers with an interest in the mathematical and computational aspects of imaging.</p>

<p> The reconstruction, enhancement, segmentation, analysis, registration, compression, representation, and tracking of two and three dimensional images are vital to many areas of science, medicine, and engineering. As a result, increasingly sophisticated mathematical, statistical, and computational methods are being employed in these research areas, which may be referred to as “imaging science”. These techniques include transform and orthogonal series methods, nonlinear optimization, numerical linear algebra, integral equations, partial differential equations, Bayesian and other statistical inverse estimation methods, operator theory, differential geometry, information theory, interpolation and approximation, inverse problems, computer graphics and vision, stochastic processes, and others.</p>

<p>The SIAG/IS awards the SIAG/IS Best Paper Prize to the authors of the best paper on mathematical and computational aspects of imaging, awards the SIAG/IS Early Career Prize to an outstanding early career researcher in the field of imaging science, and maintains a wiki, a member directory, and an electronic mailing list.</p>
