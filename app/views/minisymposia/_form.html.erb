<p>A minisymposium consists of <strong>four 25-minute presentations</strong>, with an additional five minutes for discussion after each presentation.</p>
<p>To ensure balance, SIAM prefers a single individual not be the organizer of more than one minisymposium, however, organizers can submit up to four (4) parts per minisymposium, allowing up to 16 speakers.
In addition, SIAM discourages minisymposia in which most of the speakers or co-authors come from the same institution</p>
<p>
See <%= link_to 'Guidelines for Preparing a Minisymposium Proposal', 'https://www.siam.org/meetings/guidelines/mini_guide.php' %>.  
</p>

<p>Describe your minisymposium in not more than 100 words. The summary should be written to attract those who specifically work on your topic as well as those who work in related areas. Based on experience, we suggest the following outline:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Explain the problem area to be addressed by the speakers and why it is important in significant applications.</li>
  <li>Identify current directions of research and methods being developed to solve problems, including their advantages and shortcomings.</li>
  <li> Describe the scope of your minisymposium.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is recommended that a minisymposium organizer make the first presentation.</p>
