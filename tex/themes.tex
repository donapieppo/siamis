\noindent This conference is the biennial activity of the SIAM Activity Group on Imaging Science.\\\vspace{0.5cm}

The SIAM Activity Group on Imaging Science brings together SIAM members and other scientists and engineers with an interest in the mathematical and computational aspects of imaging.
The activity group organizes the biennial SIAM Conference on Imaging Science, awards the SIAG/IS Best Paper Prize
every two years to the authors of the best paper on mathematical and computational aspects of imaging, awards the SIAG/
IS Early Career Prize to an outstanding early career researcher in the field of imaging science, and maintains a wiki, a
member directory, and an electronic mailing list.

\section*{Conference Themes}
\indent Reconstruction, enhancement, segmentation, analysis, registration, compression, representation, tomography, machine learning and tracking of two and three dimensional images are vital to many areas of science, medicine, and engineering. The increasingly sophisticated mathematical, statistical and computational methods employed in these research areas are referred to as \emph{Imaging Science}.\\ These techniques include transform and orthogonal series methods, nonlinear optimization, numerical linear algebra, integral equations, partial differential equations, Bayesian and other statistical inverse estimation methods, operator theory, differential geometry, information theory, interpolation and approximation, inverse problems, computer graphics and vision, stochastic processes, and others.\\\\
\indent SIAM-IS18 will exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of imaging science
and provide a forum for the presentation of work in imaging science.
